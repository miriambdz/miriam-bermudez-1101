title: "Why Computing Matters in Engineering- Stimulating Real World Problems"
excerpt: "Stimulating real-world problems allows engineers to predict how designs will preform under various conditions without the need of physical prototypes. Tools like Python and MATLAB are commonly used for tasks such as structual load analysis, fluid dynamics, and aerodynamic forces. These simulations provide detailed insights into engineering designs making them optimal while simultaneously reducing risk and cost."

Simulations allow engineers to predict the performance of desingns in real-world conditions, reducing the need for physical prototypes and saving time and costs. Key details include, **Structual Analysis**, **Aerodynamics for Rockets and Planes**, and **Thermal and Fluid Dynamics**. 
 
# Structual Analysis
Engineers can simulate structual loads to evaluate the strength and stability of materials and designs. Structual analysis evaluates the strength and stability of materials under various forces. It is crucial for ensuring saftey, reliability, and compliance with engineering standards. This is significant in many aspects of our daily lives, such as highways, bridges, and buildings. Engineers use tools like ANSYS or MATLAB to simulate stress, strain, and failure points all in a virtual environment, providing insights to optimize designs before production.

## Aerodynamics for Rockets and Planes

Aerodynamic simulations help engineers optimize the performance, stability, and efficiency of rockets and planes.
